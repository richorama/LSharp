Version 1.3 Not yet Released

Some features now require CLR 2
Added (spawn expression) to allow experimental multi threaded evaluation.
Added (handle-event target eventName handler) to allow .NET event handlers to be written in LSharp (and thus allow Windows Forms apps to be written in LSharp!).
Added defevent
Added symbol-name
Added gensym
Added member
Inspector shows non public fields
Bug fix - load fails when last line in file is a comment
The Console Main is no longer marked [STAThread]. This allows Windows Forms apps to
be developed, run on a secondary thread using (spawn '(run application f)) and
be dynamically and incremntally refined using the toploop on the first thread.
Cons now implements ICollecttion


Version 1.21 29 Jan 2006

Fix to TopLoop so that it prints results correctly under Mono
Fixed problem with reader so that it sees lparen as a terminating character and thus correctly 
accepts expressions like (setq a(list 1 2))
Fixed Assoc so that it returns the pair not he cadr of the pair
Fixed Assoc so that the key can be a value type or reference
Primitive functions and special forms such as prl etc are no longer case sensitive
Added copy-list and append
Updates and corrections to documentation


Version 1.2 29 Dec 2005

Moved to Visual Studio 2005 and .NET 2.0
Added some built in macros - defun, defmacro and listp
Changes to the evaluation model to deal with runtime types - symbols now evaluate to themselves, 
not their types You must now use (typeof string) to get string type object
Added assoc
read now allows you to specify an optional eof value
(is type expression) now checks supertypes as well as actual types
Added binary operators (and & , exclusive-or ^ , or | ).
Removed the prototype IDE / GUI from source release - no longer works with .NET2 and using emacs is better
Updates and corrections to documentation
