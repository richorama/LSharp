An HttpHandler which calls LSharp

Scripting web applications using LSharp has been a frequently requested feature; now
we have a solution.

Create a new ASP.NET web application project.
Change the web.config to include the following within <system.web>:

		<httpHandlers>
			<add verb="*" path="*.lsp" type="LSharp.Web.LSharpHttpHandler,LSharp.Web"/>
		</httpHandlers>

Copy LSharp.dll and LSharp.Web.dll into the bin directory of the web application.

Then write your LSharp Page as a text file with a *.lsp extension.

That's it, except to say that *content* is bound to the http context; you also have 
access to *response* *request* *session* and *application*

Here is a simple example

(write *response* "<h1>Hello World</h1> <p> Rob")

See LSharp.Web.Tests for an example included with the LSharp source distribution.

Thanks to to Ted Neward for his pointers on how to do this at DevWeek 2006.
