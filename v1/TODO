** This file contains a (partial) list of bugs and todo items for ongoing LSharp development.
* Some kind of global reset from the toploop to clear state
* Several of the special forms should now be redone as macros (e.g. when)
* (typeof string) doesnt work on Mono
* Class definition facility to be able to subclass existing classes and implement existing interfaces.
* Build a compiler to generate *.exe or *.dll from an LSharp source.
* Build a better GUI based inspector.
* Build a CLOS like object system.
* A bignumber facility for arbitrary length, arbitrary precision numbers and arithmentic.
* Ensure MONO can be a fully supported platform
* Provide an initialisation file - say init.ls which is run when the interpreter is invoked to allow the user to customise their environment.
* Provide a means of persisting one's environment, say (save filename) between interpreter sessions.
* Write a good L Sharp specific mode for GNU Emacs, or maybe support SLIME.
* Implement a wider range of ReaderMacros.
* Implement some kind of FASL facility to fast load files.
* Some Special Forms and functions should make more use of LSharpException to detect and handle errors.
* When an error occurs, show the line number of the source code file.
* Consider whether if, while, cond etc should bind "it" to the result of the expression as per ARC.
* Consider (3 string) as per ARC syntax.
* Do we need an unbind or unassign function which removes a binding from the environment?
* Implement rfn - The recursive function.
* Bug - typename collisions are not flagged - you just get the first type found.
* How do you get at fields of a class that dont have an accessor method?
* Profile the interpreter and look for opportunities for performance optimisation.
* MS Visual Studio hosted development. Bracket matching in VS2005.
* Consider implementing the notion of setfable forms, and avoiding (set_property object value).
* If your brackets dont match you get a stack overflow - we need a more explanatory error message.
* Trace should include execution timings.
* Do we need funcall ?
* no such method - give more details about types		
* SortedList, Stack and Queue seem to be reversed
* Add (Source x)
*PS: Could you consider to make a additional framed HTML reference.
(You can take a look at a newer newLISP distribution. There we have a left frame where 
all keyword are listed (and grouped) where you can click a hyperlink and the main window 
jumps to the keyword.)
