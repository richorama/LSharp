LSHARP 2 TODO List

Write some documentation!
Tutorial video
Unbalanced parenthesis can lead the reader into stack overflow.
FindUnambiguousMember for virtual methods
More opportunities to use Sequence rather than Pair?
move more stuff from C# to L#
consider a special form (clr console.writeline) that maps to a type, delegate or fn
runtime quaiquote could use sequence not pair?
Pre compile optional args to closures
Lazy sequences?
Notion of indexable Sequences
Better documentation strings on functions and macros
Think about synchronised / threading / parallel operators - pmap?
More Nunit tests
Remove other special forms like quasiquote from core and simplify the compiler?
A wpf sample
Silverlight runtime hosted version?
Implement events?
Does LSharp work with Mono?
Would using Type.GetTypeCode and TypeCode constants be faster?
Use activator for constructors?
Cleanup ssyntax
Can we build a SWANK backend to use SLIME ?
Build a more graphical repl like http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/Nov-02.html
Can we hook into visual studio object inspection tools for inspect?
Can we serialise expression trees to get a kind of FASL file?
Implement a better Debugger
Is there a way to do tail call optimsation - there is some support for this now in IL
